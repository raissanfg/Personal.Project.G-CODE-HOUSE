          <h3> Andre's Life</h3>
      
         <p id="life-story"> André Leon Talley  was an American fashion journalist, stylist, creative director, and editor-at-large of Vogue magazine.
             Andre was born in Washington, D.C. His parents left him to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Binnie Francis Davis, 
             who worked as a cleaning lady for most his childhood.
             Talley credited her for giving him an "understanding of luxury" specially when he would watch her get ready for Sunday service.</p>

        <h3 id="legacy-1">Andre's legacy </h3>

        <p id="legacy-p">Talley's career as a fashion journalist spanned six decades, earning him respect within the fashion industry. 
         
       His image has become synonymous with the capes, robes and kaftans he often wore, becoming his signature fashion item.
         
      Many of these long flowing vestments were custom-made for him by his famous designer friends including Tom Ford, Karl Lagerfeld, Valentino, and Dapper Dan. Talley often advocated for diversity during his tenure at Vogue and within the fashion industry. He also was very involved in fighting for more diversity on the runway, for more Black models" 
              
        He also helped advance the careers of POC designers, including LaQuan Smith, John Galliano, Taiwanese-Canadian designer Jason Wu, Rick Owens and many others. He  also helped include more Japanese designers in the pages of Vogue in the '90s.
