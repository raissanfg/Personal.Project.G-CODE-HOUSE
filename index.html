          <h3> Andre's Life</h3>
      
         <p id="life-story"> André Leon Talley  was an American fashion journalist, stylist, creative director, and editor-at-large of Vogue magazine.
             Andre was born in Washington, D.C. His parents left him to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Binnie Francis Davis, 
             who worked as a cleaning lady for most his childhood.
             Talley credited her for giving him an "understanding of luxury" specially when he would watch her get ready for Sunday service.</p>
